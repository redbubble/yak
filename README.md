# yak

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redbubble/yak.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redbubble/yak)

A tool to generate access keys for AWS using Okta. If you want a backronym, try 'Your AWS Kredentials'.

## Usage

### Installation

#### macOS with Homebrew

The easiest option for macOS users is to install `yak` via Homebrew.
This will also help keep `yak` up-to-date when you run `brew upgrade`
as usual.

```sh
brew tap redbubble/yak
brew install yak
```

This will also put ZSH and Bash completions in the right spot; they
should be usable next time you reload your shell config.

#### Ubuntu/Debian (`deb` package)

Download the DEB package from the [latest release](https://github.com/redbubble/yak/releases/latest) page.

You can then install it with

```
sudo apt install <filename>
```

or

```
sudo dpkg -i <filename>
```

#### RPM package

Download the RPM package from the [latest release](https://github.com/redbubble/yak/releases/latest) page.

You can then install it with

```
sudo dnf install <filename>
```

#### A note about completions

We've seen issues using tab-completion on older versions of ZSH.  It seems
that version 5.1 or newer will work correctly.

#### Go Get

This should only really be used if you want to hack on `yak`.  If you want to do that:

```
go get -u github.com/redbubble/yak
 ```

#### Manually

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/yak/releases/latest) for your architecture. The `yak` executable is statically linked,
so all you should need to do is put the executable somewhere in your `$PATH`.

This method will not give you tab-completion; if you'd like that, the completions files are available in
[/static/completions](https://github.com/redbubble/yak/tree/master/static/completions).

### Running

You can run `yak` like this:

```
yak <role> [<command>]
```

and will run `command` as `role`.

More specifically, `yak` runs `command` in the same environment it was called from, with the credentials for `role`
injected as environment variables.

When run without a command, `yak` prints those variables as `export` statements; this is intended to allow easy sourcing
into your shell.

If run with the `--list-roles` flag like this:

```
yak --list-roles
```

`yak` will print a list of available roles and exit.

#### Arguments

```
  -d, --aws-session-duration int   The session duration to request from AWS (in seconds)
      --cache-only                 Only look at cached data; do not request anything from Okta. Mutually exclusive with --no-cache
  -h, --help                       Display this help message and exit
  -l, --list-roles                 List all available AWS roles and exit
      --no-cache                   Do not use caching for this request. Mutually exclusive with --cache-only
  -u, --okta-username string       Your Okta username
```

### Configuring

Yak can be configured with a configuration file at  `~/.yak/config.toml`.

#### Okta Config

```toml
[okta]
# Required. The URL for your okta domain.
domain = "https://<my_okta_domain>.okta.com"

# Required. The path for fetching the SAML assertion from okta.
aws_saml_endpoint = "/app/amazon_aws/<saml_app_id>/sso/saml"

# Optional. Your okta username.
username = "<my_okta_username>"
```

#### AWS Config

```toml
[aws]
# Optional. Duration in seconds for the AWS credentials to last. Default 1 hour, maximum 12 hours.
session_duration = 3600
```

#### Aliases

You can configure *role aliases* in the `[alias]` section of your config file; these can be used instead of having to
remember the whole ARN:

```toml
[alias]
prod = "arn:aws:some:long:role:path"
```

This configuration would allow you to log in with:
```
yak prod [<command>]
```

## Development

### Installing dependencies

You'll need the [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) tool (if you're on macOS, `brew install dep`. Linux is a bit tricker; see the
[dep README](https://github.com/golang/dep#installation) for details).

Then run:
```
make vendor
```

This will install all your dependencies into the `vendor` directory.

### Running locally

The `make install` target will compile the application and 'install' it into your `$GOPATH`.

You can then run `$GOPATH/bin/yak`.

### Running tests

To run all the tests in the project through [go-passe](https://github.com/redbubble/go-passe), run:
```
make test
```

To run them without go-passe, or to run the tests for any individual package, you can run:
```
go test <package-directory>
```
